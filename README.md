Naiad lets you create windows with shapes in them. It is designed for creating
graphical user interfaces. It wraps [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel)
and provides a simple way to create and manipulate persistent shapes on screen.
It is as cross platform as pixel is, which is to say, very.

This library is not designed to be used in conjunction with pixel, it abstracts
it away. Eventually it will just use raw OpenGL as a backend.

It is not done yet dont use it.
