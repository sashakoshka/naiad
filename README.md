# naiad

Naiad lets you create vector-based imagery in windows. It is designed for
creating graphical user interfaces. It wraps
[pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) and provides a simple way to manage
persistent shapes on screen.

This library is not designed to be used in conjunction with pixel, it abstracts
it away. Eventually it will just use raw OpenGL as a backend.
